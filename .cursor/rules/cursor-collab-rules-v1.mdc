# Cursor Collaboration Rules v1

## Code Review Guidelines
- Review code for correctness, not style (style is automated)
- Focus on logic, architecture, and edge cases
- Be constructive and respectful
- Ask questions rather than making demands

## Pair Programming
- Take turns driving
- Communicate intentions clearly
- Explain complex decisions
- Share knowledge actively

## Communication
- Use clear commit messages
- Document complex logic
- Comment on "why" not "what"
- Keep PR descriptions detailed

## Best Practices
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid premature optimization
- Test edge cases thoroughly
